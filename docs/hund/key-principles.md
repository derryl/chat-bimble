## Key Principles

1. Positive Reinforcement

- Praise and reward are the bedrock of all dog training.
- Praise and reward create a condition of expectation within the dog, which over time create new and lasting behaviors. This is how dogs learn what we expect from them.

1. LIMA – Least Invasive Minimally Aversive

- The guiding principle of any ethical and productive approach to dog training is based on the LIMA principle.
- LIMA involves starting with the LEAST amount of force required and building up from there if the dog does not respond

1. The force of a correction must match the force of the action

- If a dog is refusing to sit, a simple tug upwards on the leash is often enough to produce the desired behavior (a sit)
- If a dog is snapping or biting, a simple tug will not be enough to stop the behavior. In this case, a sharp snap is required, or in some circumstances a more aversive approach (such as a prong collar or e-collar)

## Philosophy

- Positive reinforcement is the bedrock of all training. However, when relying only on this approach, most owners end up accidentally reinforcing the wrong behaviors and causing more problems than they solve. Positive reinforcement can teach dogs new behaviors, commands, or tricks, but in order to correct negative behavioral patterns, CORRECTION is often required.
- Correction is not punishment. We do not use the word “punish” in training. Instead we say “correct.”
- A correction is an aversive response to an undesired action. Positive reinforcement shows a dog what we want, correction shows a dog what we do not want.
- A correction must be made immediately when the undesired action is observed. You cannot correct a dog after it has finished the behavior. This would be punishment, which we do not engage in. If the dog has finished the action by the time you are aware of it, you are too late and the opportunity for correction has passed.
- For example, say you are trying to train your dog not to pee in your house and you find a puddle of urine in your kitchen. There is nothing to be done. You are too late to perform a correction and must wait until the next opportunity. The only time to correct your dog is when you catch it IN THE ACT of peeing inside.
- The best corrections are unemotional and without anger. They are designed as automatic responses to undesired actions. Performing corrections with anger or emotion is punishment and not something we recommend or engage in.

## Training principles and values

1. Leadership: Dogs need a leader. They want you to show them what to do and hold yourself with respect and dignity. See yourself as a leader and your dog will as well.
2. Boundaries: Dogs need boundaries or they will not respect your leadership. Identify your boundaries and reinforce them
3. Consistency: The key to effective and lasting training to repetition and consistency. Established rules and boundaries have to be enforced across the board, by every household member
   Not being consistent will create confusion and insecurity in your dog.
4. Encouragement: Love is the best motivator. Praise your dog when it performs commands correctly and when it respect your boundaries. Make the training process fun for your dog by giving it lots of affection and love as it performs well and modifies its behavior to meet your new expectations
5. Patience: Fear is the enemy of all training. If a dog is afraid it will shut down or regress. Do not lose patience. Do not get angry. If you find yourself getting frustrated, pause the exercise, take a breath or two, and return to the training when you are calm and collected.
6. Awareness: Being absent minded will create space for chaos and missed opportunities. When establishing new boundaries and behavioral patterns, be aware of your dog at all times.
7. Engagement and Discipline: Do the work, it won’t do itself. Hold yourself accountable and keep up with your dog’s training protocol and daily obedience exercises
